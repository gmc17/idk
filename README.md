Little genetic algorithm demonstration which allows the user to tune parameters, such as mutation rate and population size.

Each specimen has DNA which takes the form of an array, theta[], of angles. At each timestep, a small force is applied to the specimen in the theta[t] direction. No information about the environment is conveyed to the specimen.

The goal is to reach the green circle while avoiding red obstacles. The blue circle represents the population's center of mass.

Have fun!
